# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.  
The solutions are written in **Python** and are organized by day.

## Repository Structure

```

│   └── solution_part_1.py
│   └── solution_part_2.py
├── day02/
│   ├── input.py

│   ├── input.py
│   └── solution_part_1.py
│   └── solution_part_2.py

└── README.md
```

- Each `dayXX` folder contains:
  - `input.py` : where you can put your own problem input
  - `solution_part_x.py` : my solution for that part of the daily problem

## Goals

- Practice algorithmic and programming skills.  
- Explore different problem-solving techniques.  
- Share my solutions for reference and personal learning.
