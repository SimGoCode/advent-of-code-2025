# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.  
The solutions are written in **Python** and are organized by day.

## Repository Structure

```
advent-of-code-2025/
├── day01/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── solution.py
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── solution.py
...
├── day25/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── solution.py
│ 
└── README.md
```

- Each `dayXX` folder contains:
  - `input.txt` : the problem input
  - `solution.py` : my solution for that day

## Goals

- Practice algorithmic and programming skills.  
- Explore different problem-solving techniques.  
- Share my solutions for reference and personal learning.
